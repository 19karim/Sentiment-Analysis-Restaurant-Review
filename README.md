### Restaurant Review's Sentiment Analyzer  
### The Restaurant Review Sentiment Analyzer is a web application designed to analyze the sentiment of customer reviews for restaurants. The application preprocesses the reviews using the Natural Language Toolkit (nltk) and employs various machine learning algorithms to classify the sentiment of the reviews. The user interface is built using Flask, a lightweight web framework for Python.  
  



### Features  
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, tokenization, lemmatization, and more using nltk.
  
  

- Sentiment Analysis: Classification of reviews into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.
  
  

- Machine Learning Models: Various classification algorithms tested to build an accurate sentiment analysis model.
  
  

- User-Friendly Interface: Easy-to-use web interface to input and analyze reviews.  
  



### Model Building  
- Various machine learning algorithms were tested to classify the sentiment of the reviews. The following classifiers were evaluated:  
  

- Logistic Regression,
Support Vector Machines (SVM),
Naive Bayes,
Random Forest,
Gradient Boosting  
  

- The model with the best performance was selected for the final deployment. The models were trained and tested using a labeled dataset of restaurant reviews.  
  

  
  
### Usage  
After starting the Flask server, open your web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000. You will see a user interface where you can input restaurant reviews and get their sentiment analysis.
